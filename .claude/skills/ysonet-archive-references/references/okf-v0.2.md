# Open Knowledge Format (OKF) v0.2 - reference

Captured 2026-08-03 from the specification and the v0.2 announcement.

- Specification: <https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/tree/main/okf>
- v0.2 announcement: <https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/okf-v0-2-adds-trust-signals/>

Kept locally so the archive tool and this workflow have a stable yardstick that
does not need re-fetching. Refresh it if the specification moves; do not fetch it
on every run.

## What OKF is

A document is **Markdown with YAML frontmatter**. The frontmatter carries
structured metadata and trust signals; the body carries prose and tables. It
exists so an agent writing knowledge and an agent consuming it agree on where
the provenance lives, rather than each inventing its own field names.

It fits this archive almost exactly: a preserved reference already IS a Markdown
document whose value depends on where it came from and whether it can be
trusted.

## Fields

### Required

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `type` | short string naming the concept kind. No central registry; producers choose. Consumers must tolerate unknown values |

### Recommended

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `title` | human-readable display name |
| `description` | single-sentence summary |
| `resource` | URI uniquely identifying the underlying asset |
| `tags` | list of short categorisation strings |

### Provenance

`sources` - list of materials the concept derives from.

- required per entry: `resource` (URL, bundle path, or scope descriptor)
- optional per entry: `id`, `title`, `author`, `usage_count`, `last_modified`
- optional sibling: `usage_window: { from: YYYY-MM-DD, to: YYYY-MM-DD }`

### Trust

- `generated: { by: <actor>, at: <ISO 8601 datetime> }`
- `verified:` a list of verification events, or a single `{ by, at }` mapping

Trust tiers are DERIVED from `verified`, not declared:

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| no `verified` key | unverified |
| machine actors only | machine-confirmed |
| any `human:<id>` entry | human-reviewed |

**Absence carries meaning.** An archive with no `verified` key is honestly
saying nobody has checked it, which is better than a field claiming otherwise.

### Lifecycle and freshness

- `status`: `draft` | `stable` | `deprecated` (default `stable`)
- `stale_after`: absolute date `YYYY-MM-DD`. Content is stale when
  `today >= stale_after`. Absolute, never a duration, so it needs no clock
  arithmetic to interpret.

### Actor convention

| Form | Use |
|---|---|
| `<producer>/<version>` | an agent or tool, e.g. `ysonet-refs/1` |
| `human:<id>` | a person, e.g. `human:irsdl` |
| `process:<id>` | an automated process |

## Rules that matter here

- **Reserved filenames**: `index.md` is the directory listing, `log.md` is the
  update history. Every other `.md` is a concept document.
- **Custom fields are permitted**, and consumers must preserve unknown keys. So
  this archive keeps its own fields (`content_sha256`, `depth`, `cited_by`,
  `retrieved_kind`) alongside the OKF ones without breaking conformance.
- **Directory structure is producer-defined.**
- A conformant bundle has parseable frontmatter with a non-empty `type` in every
  non-reserved `.md` file.
- Consumers must tolerate missing optional fields, unknown `type` values,
  unknown keys, broken cross-links and a missing `index.md`.

## How this archive maps onto it

| OKF field | Archive value |
|---|---|
| `type` | the reference kind, title-cased: `Article`, `Advisory`, `Vendor Doc`, `Whitepaper`, `Slides`, `Video`, `Repository`, `Code` |
| `title` | the resolved document title |
| `description` | the source's own one-sentence description where it declares one |
| `resource` | the original URL as cited |
| `tags` | kind, language, publisher and `ysonet-reference` |
| `sources` | where the bytes actually came from: the original URL, the canonical location, a capture timestamp or a repository commit |
| `generated` | `by: ysonet-refs/<n>`, `at:` the retrieval time |
| `verified` | ABSENT until the validation gate has run. Absence is the honest state |
| `status` | `stable` when healthy, `draft` when queued for review, `deprecated` when the source is gone |
| `stale_after` | one year after retrieval, so a preserved copy is re-checked rather than trusted forever |

Anything OKF does not cover stays as a custom key, which the specification
explicitly allows.
