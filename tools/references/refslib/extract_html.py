"""HTML to Markdown: the document, not the website.

Public research Markdown has to contain the article, not the template. The risk
runs both ways and only one of them is loud:

* keep too much and the file is menus, cookie notices and related-post lists;
* keep too little and the payload listings vanish, which is the exact failure
  this whole archive exists to undo. A site redesign that flattened the code
  blocks is invisible unless something MEASURES that they were there.

So extraction produces three candidates and measures each, rather than trusting
one heuristic:

* `precision` - the innermost `<main>`/`<article>`/`role=main` container.
* `recall`    - the block with the most text after boilerplate removal.
* `raw`       - the whole body, minus obvious chrome.

The caller compares the metrics (characters, headings, code blocks, tables,
figures, links) and sends an unexplained loss to review instead of quietly
picking the shortest output. Nothing here runs JavaScript: `html.parser` is a
tokenizer, and extraction always reads STORED bytes, never a live page.
