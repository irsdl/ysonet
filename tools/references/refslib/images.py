"""Preserve the pictures an archived article was written around.

A screenshot of the vulnerable response, a diagram of the desync, a slide: for a
lot of these write-ups the picture IS the finding, and the archive kept none of
them. The Markdown hotlinks the publisher's copy - which works until the host
blocks hotlinking or goes away - and the rendered PDF carried no images at all,
only `[image: alt]` where each one belonged.

WHAT IS STORED IS NEVER WHAT WAS FETCHED. Every image is decoded to a pixel
buffer and re-encoded into a new file, and the fetched bytes are dropped on the
floor:

* EXIF, ICC profiles, XMP, comments and every other ancillary chunk are gone,
  because nothing but pixels is carried across;
* a polyglot - a PDF, a ZIP or a script appended to a valid JPEG - does not
  survive being decoded and written back out;
* lossy re-encoding changes pixel values but cannot guarantee removal of hidden
  signals or instructions represented in the visible image;
* externally supplied SVG is refused by this raster pipeline because it can
  carry active content and needs a separate, bounded interpretation policy.

That is also why re-encoding is not negotiable for the sake of a smaller diff:
the archive is exploit research, and its readers are agents.

SIZE IS A DESIGN CONSTRAINT, not an afterthought. Images are embedded in the
PDFs the archive renders itself and are NOT published as files in the
repository as a second set of assets. They are held in the
content store, out of the repository, and baked into the one artefact that
cannot go and fetch them later.
