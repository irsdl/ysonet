## Why it is in ysonet

The deck names four gadgets this tool already ships - `ResXFileRef`,
`ResourceSet`, `ObjectDataProvider` and `XamlImageInfo` - and states what they
have in common: each is reached by resolving an attacker-named type during a
plain string-to-object conversion, with no serializer at the entry point.
Slides 22 and 23 credit Soroush Dalili's 2018 `.RESX` research for
`ResXFileRef`, and for naming `ResourceSet`, `ResXResourceSet` and
`ResourceReader` as the stream gadgets that carry it to code execution. The
deck also states where each gadget is reachable on .NET Framework versus
modern .NET, which is the kind of evidence a runtime version claim in
`Facets()` needs.

The companion whitepaper is archived beside this file and carries the full
argument, the gadget listings and the SharePoint disclosure chains.

## Summary

Mirosh argues that string-to-object conversion is a vulnerability class of its
own, separate from insecure deserialization, and that the industry missed it
because the post-2017 hardening drew its border around the serializer. His name
for the vulnerable code is the Transformation Layer: the mechanisms that turn a
plain string into a constructed object with no serializer in between. They do
the same two things a serializer does, select a type and populate an instance,
with none of the machinery, so there is no `TypeNameHandling` to set, no
`SerializationBinder` to review, and no parser configuration to harden.

A mechanism becomes what he calls an Insecure String Transformer when four
conditions hold: it accepts an attacker-controlled string, it resolves a type
during conversion, it instantiates or populates an object of that type, and it
does not sufficiently restrict which types may resolve. The first three make an
ordinary transformer; the fourth makes it a weapon.

Five primitives carry the attack: `TypeConverter.ConvertFrom`, a static
`Parse`/`TryParse`, `new T(string)`, a parameterless constructor followed by
property accessors, and custom conversion logic. The last one has no signature
to grep for, which is why the deck ends on behavioral hunting rather than
pattern matching.

On availability, .NET Framework is described as wide open, because the GAC lets
any process load any registered assembly by name, so the inventory is the whole
machine rather than what the application shipped. Modern .NET is narrowed but
not closed: many high-value gadgets still arrive with
`Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App`, and one desktop reference deep in a dependency
graph pulls them back.

The real-world section walks CVE-2020-1460 in SharePoint, where a workflow XML
attribute supplies the type name and the insert arguments supply the string,
and the two meet on a `GetConverter(type).ConvertFromString(value)` call
reachable by an unprivileged user in a default configuration. It then covers
four 2026 SharePoint CVEs, each sitting behind a restriction that was bypassed,
including a generic type argument smuggled through a `SafeControl` check that
validates the control type but not its property types.

The defensive advice is to take the type choice back: do not resolve a type
from input at all where the type is not truly dynamic, and where it is,
validate the name against a known-good allowlist before resolution rather than
after, because resolution itself can run code. Blocklists are rejected outright
as naming only what is already known.

TYPECONVERTER GADGETS: WHERE IT STARTSThe transformer's authorhad a few types in view: a Color, a Point, a domain type of its ownnever saw the full set the process can resolveThe converter's authorbuilt for its own callers,and judged the code safe therenever weighed being reachable by anyone who can name its typeNothing connects them but the type name the attacker supplies.XamlSerializationWrapperConverter · EndpointCollectionConverterOurs in 2017. Both needed Visual Studio installed.The next ones don't.§3.220

--- page 25 ---

PARSE()A type buildable from a string exposes a static Parse()/TryParse().Both build an instance from the string.Type t = Type.GetType(typeName);RESOLUTIONinput becomes a Typereturn m.Invoke(null, new[] { value });EXECUTIONthe type's own Parse runs itListing 18 C# The Parse sink: reflective static Parse invocationInt32 · DateTime · Guid · Version · TimeSpanNo second class to find.

NEW T(STRING)The plainest transformer: hand a string to a single-argument constructor.Writing new T(s)is the most routine thing in the language.Type t = Type.GetType(typeName);RESOLUTIONinput becomes a Typereturn Activator.CreateInstance(t, new[]{value});EXECUTIONthe constructor runsListing 24 C# The constructor sink: construction is the triggernew Uri(s) · new Version(s) · new Guid(s) · new MailAddress(s)No method to locate, no converter to resolve. Construction is the whole operation.§3.427

--- page 28 ---

CONSTRUCTOR GADGETS: THE STRING IS A PATHA single-string constructor that opens an attacker-named path.Make it a UNC path and any of them reaches out.FILE READStreamReader(path)opens the file at constructionAssemblyDependencyResolver(path)ships in Microsoft.NETCore.AppFileSystemWatcher(path)Directory.Exists contacts the hostFILE WRITEStreamWriter(path)creates the file, or truncates it to emptyResourceWriter(path)the same, disguised as resourcesreset a file: DoS. Create one: flip an existence check.a flush on dispose or finalize becomes a real writeThe string names the path. The constructor does the rest.§3.428

--- page 29 ---

THE 3.2 RCE GADGETS, NO CARRIERBoth were §3.2 gadgets. Each also exposes a string constructor.new ResourceSet(string)reaches modern .NET, narrowing with each releasenew WorkflowServiceBehavior(string).NET Framework only. WF was never ported.WHAT'S NEWIn §3.2, ResXFileRef had to hand them a stream.No carrier. The constructor opens the path itself.The path can be UNC. The bytes come from a remote share.§3.429

--- page 30 ---

SETTERS AND GETTERSThis one empties the constructor and moves the code to the members.Every assignment runs its accessor.Type t = Type.GetType(typeName);RESOLUTIONinput becomes a Typeobject obj = Activator.CreateInstance(t);foreach (var (name, value) in inputPairs)PropertyInfo p = t.GetProperty(name);SELECTIONthe name picks the memberp.SetValue(obj, value);EXECUTIONthe selected accessor runsListing 30 C# The accessor sink: create, then populate by attacker-named propertyAny accessor can run code. And the most capable one comes next.§3.530

--- page 31 ---

THE KING: OBJECTDATAPROVIDERIts job is to call a method on an object and show the result.The whole operation is exposed as settable properties.public void set_MethodName(string value) {this._methodName = value;_objectType.InvokeMember(MethodName, flags,_objectInstance, methodParams);Listing 32 C# ObjectDataProvider: setting properties reaches InvokeMemberTHREE COMBINATIONSObjectInstance + MethodNamecall any method on a supplied objectObjectType + parametersconstruct any type, your argumentsthe two togetherconstruct it, then call any method on itSame reach as the XAML factories.Canonical RCE payload: ObjectInstance = Process, MethodName = Start.§3.531

--- page 32 ---

CUSTOM CONVERSION LOGICThe first four are the standard shapes, not a closed list.Each had a name a reviewer could grep.GetConverter() · static Parse() · new T(string) · a property-setting loopCustom conversion logic offers no such handle.IN THE WILDCVE-2020-1147Four shapes we can name.

THREE HUNTSThere is no serializer call to grep for, and no payload format to match.The transformer hunt runs in three passes.the shared huntinput becomes a Type one query, all fivethe sink huntthe conversion that consumes the resolved typethe gadget huntwhat that type does, across everything loadableThree hunts named. Now the rules for each.§5.143

--- page 44 ---

THE NECK: INPUT BECOMES A TYPEEach transformer begins here: input becomes a Type.The sink only decides what happens next.\b\w*(Get|Resolve|Create|Load)Type\w*\s*\( # framework calls and wrappersActivator\.CreateInstance\s*\( # name-based overloadsListing 46 regex shared hunt: type resolution, text searchbase patterns, to show the shape of the hunt not production rulesA wrapper can hide the base call.builder.GetType() · registry.Resolve() · loader.Create()any method that takes a name and returns a Type is a candidateOne door in for all five. And no way to reach the code without it.§5.144

--- page 45 ---

FIVE SINKS, ONE SHAPEOnce the type is resolved, each primitive collapses to one short call.Learn the shapes and the sink hunt is a scan.TypeConverterParsenew T(string)Activator.CreateInstance(type, value)Setters / gettersCustom logicno signature Matching the sink finds the conversion. Finding the gadget makes it an attack.§5.145

--- page 49 ---

KILL THE CLASS: ONE CONDITIONEvery finding here reduces to one condition: input chooses the type.Address it and the class disappears.1Gate the type before conversiona check before resolution is safest resolution itself can carry risk2Limit to a known-good seta list of the types you expect, never a description of the ones you fearsanitize the name first, resolve second, and never resolve a name you have not clearedThe type choice is the vulnerability. Take it back and nothing fires.§5.449

--- page 50 ---

REMOVE THE CHOICEThe strongest fix is to not resolve a type from input at all.Often the type is not truly dynamic: pin it in code.// input-driven type: the whole class in one linevar obj = Convert(Type.GetType(input.TypeName), input.Value);// fixed type: nothing to steervar address = ParseAddress(input.Value); Listing 64 C# input-driven vs. fixed destination typepossible far more often than the code suggestsIf no input chooses the type, there is nothing to exploit.§5.450

--- page 51 ---

RESTRICT THE CHOICEWhen the type genuinely varies, restrict which names may resolve.Matched against a known-good set, checked before resolution.static readonly HashSet<string> Allowed = new(){ "System.Int32", "System.DateTime", "MyApp.Models.CustomerAddress" };if (!Allowed.Contains(inputTypeName))throw new SecurityException($"Type not permitted: {inputTypeName}");Type t = Type.GetType(inputTypeName); // only for an approved nameListing 65 C# exact-name allowlist at the sinkCheck the name before resolution: resolution itself may run code.Blocklists: not a defense. They name only what is already known.Restrict which types can resolve, and the conversion layer goes quiet.§5.451
